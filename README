# Devbox

This is a script that sets up my preferred dev environment. 

It is based on Ubuntu Groovy.

Key parts include VSCode Server as an IDE, kind for creating Kubernetes clusters,
and a lot of Go tools. 

If you have Vagrant already set up, you should be able to cd into this directory, and run
vagrant up to get a full copy of it. It takes a few minutes though.
